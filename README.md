And also, teenage drivers are in the highest risk of car crashes. One of the most important reasons is that they are inexperienced. Hopefully, this website can solve the problem that people who are not aware of the importance of careful driving and prepare those novice drivers of potential drivers prepare well for their future driving journey.

*	Formative assessments
When I was designing this website, after finishing every single site, I will show it to my friend and ask their opinion about it. I plan to carry out a survey to learn what is every user’s purpose for using this website. And take down the data that which button did they click and how long did they spend on this page.
*	Summative assessments
I have a practice page to test their knowledge of traffic regulations. I also plan to have a survey in my website to investigate did my website fulfil their needs.

# Reflection
For the final project, I used several Javascript functions in the website. It is really difficult for me at very first because what I have learnt on Codeacademy is a little bit disconnected to the real experience. I didn't learn how to import Javascript into my project but I learnt it in class. As we learnt in class, Javascript provides functions for our websites. It is really excited to see that the Javascript I put in my website makes my page more interactive and have more real functions such as count the success rate for the practice. My midterm experience has taught me that I should inspect every small part of my pages to avoid making mistakes. I have used bootstrap for my midterm project, and it gives me basic understanding of how to Javascript because it is quite similar of the way how to use them in my code.
